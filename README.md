 Scenario: Smart Financial Management System [20 marks]
SecureBank wants to develop an automated financial management system using Python. Your task is to implement different financial operations step by step.

This system will:
âœ… Assess customer eligibility for loans.
âœ… Classify investment portfolios based on risk.
âœ… Automate loan repayment tracking.
âœ… Monitor stock market trends and trigger alerts.
âœ… Track currency exchange rates and suggest conversions.

Task is to break down the requirements, write a structured plan, and implement the logic step by step using ipywidgets for interactive user inputs.

ðŸŸ¢ Part 1: Loan Eligibility & Interest Rate Calculation [4 marks]
ðŸ“Œ Requirement:
SecureBank only approves loans if the customer meets all eligibility criteria. The system should:
âœ” Check if the customer is employed.
âœ” Verify if the income is at least PKR 50,000.
âœ” Check credit score:

750+ â†’ 5% Interest Rate
650 - 749 â†’ 8% Interest Rate
Below 650 â†’ Loan Rejected
âœ” If the applicant is unemployed, the loan is rejected immediately.

Implementation of code
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display

    def check_loan_eligibility(employment_status, income, credit_score):
    if employment_status == 'Unemployed':
        return "Loan Rejected: Applicant is unemployed."

    if income < 50000:
        return "Loan Rejected: Minimum income requirement not met."

    if credit_score >= 750:
        return "Loan Approved: Interest Rate = 5%"
    elif 650 <= credit_score < 750:
        return "Loan Approved: Interest Rate = 8%"
    else:
        return "Loan Rejected: Credit score too low."


    employment_status_widget = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=['Employed', 'Unemployed'],
    value='Employed',
    description='Employment:',
    )

    income_widget = widgets.IntText(
    value=50000,
    description='Income:',
    )

    credit_score_widget = widgets.IntSlider(
    value=700,
    min=300,
    max=850,
    step=10,
    description='Credit Score:',
    )

    output = widgets.Output()

    def on_button_click(b):
    with output:
        output.clear_output()
        result = check_loan_eligibility(
            employment_status_widget.value,
            income_widget.value,
            credit_score_widget.value
        )
        print(result)

    button = widgets.Button(description="Check Loan Eligibility")
    button.on_click(on_button_click)

    display(employment_status_widget, income_widget, credit_score_widget, button, output)

ðŸŸ¢ Part 2: Investment Risk Assessment:

ðŸ“Œ Requirement:
SecureBank offers investment analysis services. The system should evaluate a portfolio of stocks and classify the risk level based on stock returns:
âœ” If any stock has a negative return, the portfolio is High Risk.
âœ” If all stocks have positive returns, but at least one return is below 5%, classify as Medium Risk.
âœ” If all stock returns are 5% or above, classify as Low Risk.

Implementation Steps:
ðŸ”¹ Step 1:  loops to iterate through the list of stock returns.
ðŸ”¹ Step 2:  if-elif conditions to classify the risk.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3:  Python program using ipywidgets to allow users to input stock returns interactively and receive a risk assessment.

Implementation:

    import ipywidgets as widgets
    from IPython.display import display

    def assess_risk(returns):
    try:
        returns = [float(r) for r in returns.split(',')]
        if any(r < 0 for r in returns):
            risk = "High Risk"
        elif all(r >= 5 for r in returns):
            risk = "Low Risk"
        else:
            risk = "Medium Risk"

        result_label.value = f"Portfolio Risk Level: {risk}"
    except ValueError:
        result_label.value = "Invalid input! Please enter numeric values separated by commas."


    returns_input = widgets.Text(placeholder="Enter stock returns")
    assess_button = widgets.Button(description="Assess Risk")
    result_label = widgets.Label(value="")

    def on_button_click(b):
    assess_risk(returns_input.value)

    assess_button.on_click(on_button_click)

    display(returns_input, assess_button, result_label)

Part 3: Loan Repayment Tracker
ðŸ“Œ Requirement:
Customers who receive a loan should be able to track their loan balance as they make monthly payments. The system should:
âœ” Start with an initial loan balance (e.g., PKR 500,000).
âœ” Deduct a fixed monthly payment (e.g., PKR 25,000).
âœ” Continue tracking until loan balance reaches zero.
âœ” Display the remaining balance after each payment.

Implementation Steps:
ðŸ”¹ Step 1:  appropriate loop (for or while).
ðŸ”¹ Step 2:  loop stops once the loan is fully paid.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Python program using ipywidgets to simulate loan repayment interactively.	

Implementation:

		import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display

    def track_loan(initial_balance, monthly_payment):
    balance = initial_balance
    output.clear_output()

    with output:
        print("Loan Repayment Tracker")
        print("----------------------")
        while balance > 0:
            print(f"Remaining Balance: PKR {balance}")
            balance -= monthly_payment
            if balance < 0:
                balance = 0
        print(f"Final Balance: PKR {balance} (Loan Fully Paid)")


    initial_balance_widget = widgets.IntText(value=500000, description="Loan Amount:")
    monthly_payment_widget = widgets.IntText(value=25000, description="Monthly Payment:")
    track_button = widgets.Button(description="Track Loan")
    output = widgets.Output()

    def on_button_click(b):
    track_loan(initial_balance_widget.value, monthly_payment_widget.value)

    track_button.on_click(on_button_click)

    display(initial_balance_widget, monthly_payment_widget, track_button, output)

ðŸŸ¢ Part 4: Stock Price Monitoring and Trading Strategy 
ðŸ“Œ Requirement:
A stock trader wants to track stock prices daily and sell when the price reaches PKR 200. The system should:
âœ” Iterate through a list of stock prices.
âœ” Skip missing stock data (None values).
âœ” Stop tracking once the price reaches PKR 200.

Implementation Steps:
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Handle missing stock data using continue.
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Stop tracking once the stock hits the target price (break).
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Python program using ipywidgets to process stock prices interactively and trigger alerts when conditions are met.

Implementation:

    import ipywidgets as widgets
    from IPython.display import display

    def track_stock_prices(prices):
    output.clear_output()
    for price in prices:
        if price is None:
            continue

        with output:
            print(f"Tracking stock price: PKR {price}")

        if price >= 200:
            with output:
                print("Target price reached! Consider selling.")
            break


    prices_input = widgets.Text(
    placeholder="Enter stock prices separated by commas"
    )

    track_button = widgets.Button(description="Track Prices")
    output = widgets.Output()

    def on_button_click(b):
    try:
        prices = [int(x.strip()) if x.strip() else None for x in prices_input.value.split(',')]
        track_stock_prices(prices)
    except ValueError:
        with output:
            print("âš  Please enter valid numbers separated by commas!")

    track_button.on_click(on_button_click)

    display(prices_input, track_button, output)

Part 5: Currency Exchange Rate Tracker 
ðŸ“Œ Requirement:
SecureBank provides real-time currency exchange tracking. The system should:
âœ” Start at PKR 290/USD.
âœ” Increase by 1 PKR per day until it reaches PKR 300/USD.
âœ” Print exchange rates daily and stop when the target rate is reached.

Implementation Steps:
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Suitable loop (for or while).
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Stop the loop when the exchange rate reaches the target.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Python program using ipywidgets to track the currency exchange rate interactively.

Implementation:

    import ipywidgets as widgets
    from IPython.display import display
    import time

    def track_exchange_rate():

    exchange_rate = 290
    target_rate = 300


    label = widgets.Label(value=f"Current Exchange Rate: PKR {exchange_rate}/USD")
    display(label)

    while exchange_rate <= target_rate:
        label.value = f"Current Exchange Rate: PKR {exchange_rate}/USD"
        time.sleep(0.5)
        exchange_rate += 1
        if exchange_rate > target_rate:
            label.value = "Exchange rate tracking stopped. Target reached!"
            break


    track_exchange_rate()
